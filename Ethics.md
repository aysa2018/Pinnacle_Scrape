# ETHICS

## Purpose and Intent

This project involves scraping publicly accessible data from Pinnacle for **educational purposes only**. The goal is to provide users with more information to help them make educated decisions when placing bets. It is not designed to exploit any individual or party, nor does it facilitate unfair practices or gain.

## Respect for Website Policies

The scraping script strictly adheres to Pinnacle's `robots.txt` guidelines. Specifically:
- **Disallowed sections:**
  - `Disallow: */account/*`
  - `Disallow: */search/*`
  
  These areas are not accessed or interacted with by the code.

## Responsible Data Usage

- **No Personal Data:** The scraping process does not access or collect any personal or sensitive data.
- **Single Page Load:** To minimize server load and respect Pinnacle's resources, the webpage is scraped only **once per session**. This ensures responsible use of web infrastructure and avoids server overloading.

## Educational and Fair Use

The primary objective of this project is to promote **informed decision-making**. Users are encouraged to engage with the data responsibly and understand that the information provided is meant to enhance educational understanding of sports betting odds and statistics.
