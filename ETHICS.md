# ETHICS

## Purpose and Intent

This project is intended to scrape publicly available data from Pinnacle for **educational purposes only**. The main objective is to provide users with relevant data so they may make educated decisions when betting. The initiative has no intention of taking advantage of people or organizations, facilitating unfair advantages in gambling, or endorsing any unethical behavior.

## Respect for Website Policies

The scraping script strictly adheres to Pinnacle's `robots.txt` guidelines. Specifically:
- **Disallowed sections:**
  - `Disallow: */account/*`
  - `Disallow: */search/*`
  
  These areas are not accessed or interacted with by the code.

## Responsible Data Usage

- **No Personal Data Collection:** The scraping process is strictly limited to public information and does not access, store, or interact with any personal or sensitive data.
- **Minimal Server Load:** The script scrapes the webpage **only once per session** to minimize server load and respect Pinnacle's resources. This responsible usage helps prevent undue strain on their web infrastructure.

## Educational and Fair Use

The primary objective of this project is to promote **informed decision-making**. Users are encouraged to engage with the data responsibly and understand that the information provided is meant to enhance educational understanding of sports betting odds and statistics.
