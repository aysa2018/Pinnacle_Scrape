# Pinnacle Football Scraper

## Project Description
This project scrapes upcoming NFL and college football game spreads and associated team names from Pinnacle.com, known for offering some of the most accurate betting odds. The collected data allows users to compare Pinnacle's odds with other sportsbooks, helping identify positive Expected Value (EV) bets or avoid negative EV bets. The tool is particularly valuable for sports bettors looking to make informed decisions based on market-leading odds.

## Why Pinnacle?
Pinnacle is a highly regarded sportsbook, offering sharp lines that are often more accurate than those of competitors. By using this scraper, bettors can access Pinnacle's spreads to:
- **Find Positive EV Bets**: Compare Pinnacle's odds to your sportsbook and find situations where your sportsbook offers better odds than Pinnacle, suggesting potential value.
- **Avoid Negative EV Bets**: Avoid bets where your sportsbook has worse odds than Pinnacle, reducing the likelihood of making a losing wager in the long term.

## Data Collected
The scraper retrieves the following data for each football game:
- **Team Names**: The two teams playing in each upcoming game.
- **Spread Odds**: The point spread odds for both teams.
